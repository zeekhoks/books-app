# The Books Nook

The Books Nook is a simple and elegant web application built using TypeScript, React, and React-Bootstrap. It allows users to search for books by various criteria such as book title, author, number of pages, contributors, and author's alternative names. The application leverages the Open Library API to fetch and display book information in a user-friendly table format. Users can paginate through results and sort them by the year of first publication in both ascending and descending order.
